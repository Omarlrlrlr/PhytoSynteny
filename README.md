🌿 PlantiSyn

PlantiSyn is an automated and reproducible Snakemake-based pipeline for the detection, annotation, and comparative analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in plant genomes.

📌 Overview

PlantiSyn provides an end-to-end workflow to identify biosynthetic gene clusters in plant genomes using PlantiSMASH, followed by downstream comparative analyses such as orthology mapping, BED file generation, and synteny-based investigations (e.g. via MCScan).
