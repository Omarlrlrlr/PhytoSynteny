🌿 PhytoSynteny
PhytoSynteny is an automated and reproducible Snakemake-based pipeline for the detection, annotation, and comparative analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in plant genomes.

📌 Overview
PhytoSynteny provides an end-to-end workflow to identify biosynthetic gene clusters in plant genomes using PlantiSMASH, followed by downstream comparative analyses such as orthology mapping, BED file generation, and synteny-based investigations.
